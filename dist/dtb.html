                    Downtown Bazooka is a rocket-jumping third-person action & exploration platformer written in C++ using SFML and OpenGL for my sophomore year Video Game Development Club project.
                    The objective is to reach all of the waypoints and then defeat the final boss.
                </p>
                <p class="item-text">
                    The idea of the game actually came from just the name, which one of the officers in the club had created by using a random game name generator.
                    Drawing inspiration from the likes of Tron and Mad Max, we created a vast 3D world in which players could explore infinitely.

                <p class="item-text">
                    Downtown Bazooka presented me with a unique opportunity that I have yet to deal with again: the ability to work with a custom C++ game engine (written by John), and write code using that engine.
                </p>
                <p class="item-text">
                    For programming, the most valuable thing I learned was being able to read and understand other people's code.
                    It was a skill that I had not really had the chance to use until this project, as being able to read the engine code and understand what parts of it I needed to use was an important part of being able to contribute to this project.
                </p>
                <p class="item-text">
                    Additionally, I had a lot of fun designing and programming the final boss battle.
                    I also implemented some other things, such as the health bar, the items, etc., which would have only taken a few seconds in Unity, but ended up taking much longer in this project due to having to learn how the engine works.

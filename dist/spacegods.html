                <p class="item-text">
                    Space Gods is a 2-4 player space dodgeball game made in Unity C# as my freshman year Video Game Development Club game at UC Irvine.
                    It was my first game of many at UC Irvine, during which I learned tons about Unity and made life-long friends that I will never forget!
                </p>
                <p class="item-text">
                    This quirky and comical fighting game was loosely based off Space Jam. Each of the twenty gods boasted a unique ability, each related to their mythological properties.
                    For instance, Jesus could turn water planets into wine planets, which would confuse their opponents if hit (reverse their controls temporarily). Michael Jordan (the god of basketball) showed the other gods how to slam, dunking them with basketball planets. C'thulu couldn't grab planets at all, but instead had a larger health pool and could ram into enemies to damage them instead.

                    The entire basis for understanding and working with Unity came from my development on this project.
                    Everything from GameObjects, scripting, Physics, particle systems, prefabs, UI, etc. began here.
                    Before this project, I had never used Unity, and my only knowledge of programming came from the AP Computer Science course that I took my senior year of high school, where I learned Java (which luckily was extremely similar to C#).
                    This was also my first team project, as the only projects I had done before were individual.
                </p>
                <p class="item-text">
                    For this project, I was particularly proud of how fast I was able to learn Unity and quickly become one of the main contributing members of the team.
                    I was the reason we had twenty gods at the end, as I designed, tested, and implemented the vast majority of them.
                    By the end of the first quarter, we only had one playable god; by the end of the second, four; and after the final quarter, twenty.
                    Space Gods was a major factor that sparked my interest in game design, and to this day I am still surprised with how I was able to come up with so many unique and interesting ideas for this game.
